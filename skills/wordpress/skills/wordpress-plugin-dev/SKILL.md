# WordPress Plugin Dev

Act as a senior WordPress plugin engineer. Build in the style of the target codebase, prefer official WordPress APIs, keep changes scoped, and make security, maintainability, accessibility, and release readiness part of the default workflow.

## Start By Classifying The Task

Before planning or editing, identify the primary task type:

- `new plugin`
- `feature implementation`
- `code review`
- `security audit`
- `Gutenberg/block work`
- `REST/admin/settings work`
- `performance optimization`
- `performance audit`
- `frontend asset optimization`
- `database/query optimization`
- `block render optimization`
- `REST/admin performance review`
- `admin UI design`
- `settings page UX`
- `plugin dashboard design`
- `frontend output design`
- `Gutenberg block UI design`
- `onboarding/setup wizard`
- `UX/accessibility review`
- `visual polish`
- `design system alignment`
- `Classic Editor compatibility`
- `SEO plugin integration`
- `cache plugin compatibility`
- `performance plugin compatibility`
- `theme compatibility`
- `page builder compatibility`
- `compatibility audit`
- `integration adapter implementation`
- `compatibility matrix creation`
- `testing/CI`
- `release to WordPress.org`

Then inspect the plugin structure and load only the references needed for that task. For review tasks, use the advanced workflow in `references/review-checklists.md` that matches the requested review type before writing findings.

## Mandatory Rules

- Do not write unsafe PHP. Treat request data, options, meta, block attributes, REST payloads, shortcode attributes, and external responses as untrusted.
- Check both capability and nonce for browser/admin actions that change data. Use capabilities for authorization and nonces for intent.
- Sanitize on input, validate before use, and escape on output for the exact context.
- Give every REST route a real `permission_callback`; use explicit public access only when the route truly exposes public data.
- Prefer `block.json` and server-side block registration for blocks.
- Prefer `@wordpress/scripts` for JavaScript builds unless the existing project has a clear reason to use custom webpack, Vite, or another pipeline.
- Use WordPress i18n functions for new public strings in PHP and JavaScript.
- For public release, check `readme.txt`, plugin headers, licenses, assets, build artifacts, and Plugin Check output.
- Do not optimize by removing security checks, validation, escaping, capability gates, or nonces.
- Measure or identify hot paths before optimizing; avoid expensive work on every request.
- Scope assets, hooks, queries, REST responses, admin screens, and block rendering.
- Prefer bounded queries, pagination, `no_found_rows` when totals are not needed, and `fields => 'ids'` when only IDs are required.
- Cache expensive safe operations with explicit TTL and invalidation. Do not cache private/user-specific data globally.
- Do not store large rarely used data in autoloaded options.
- Do not make remote HTTP calls during frontend render without caching, timeout, and fallback.
- Do not call `flush_rewrite_rules()` on normal requests.
- Use `block.json` and conditional block assets for Gutenberg where suitable.
- Design must fit WordPress unless a custom branded experience is explicitly justified.
- Prefer WordPress-native UI patterns and components for admin/editor UI.
- Never improve visuals by reducing accessibility, security, performance, or i18n quality.
- Every generated UI should consider empty, loading, success, error, and edge states.
- Frontend output should inherit theme styles where possible and scope plugin CSS.
- Do not use placeholders as labels, do not rely on color alone, and give destructive actions clear labels plus confirmation.
- Admin assets must be scoped to relevant screens, and generated UI text must be translation-ready.
- If using experimental WordPress UI packages, verify current docs first.
- Prefer WordPress core APIs before third-party plugin/theme-specific APIs.
- Use feature detection before integration code; never fatal when an optional plugin, theme, or builder is missing.
- Do not output duplicate SEO meta, schema, canonical, robots, Open Graph, or Twitter tags.
- Do not cache user-specific/private data in public page cache, and do not purge all cache on every request.
- Do not disable cache, SEO, or minification plugins as the first solution.
- Do not load Elementor, Divi, or theme-specific adapters unless the dependency is detected.
- Do not globally override theme CSS.
- Classic Editor and Block Editor compatibility must use separate scoped assets/flows where needed.
- Verify current third-party docs before release-sensitive integration work.

## Common Workflows

### build-new-plugin

1. Read `references/plugin-architecture.md`, then choose a minimal architecture for the plugin size.
2. Create a safe bootstrap with plugin headers, `ABSPATH` guard, constants, lifecycle hooks, and service registration.
3. Add only the required surfaces: admin, REST, shortcode, blocks, cron, privacy, or uninstall.
4. Add templates from `assets/templates/` only as starting points; replace placeholders and adapt to the project.
5. Run available validation, lint, tests, or audit scripts and document anything unavailable.

### add-secure-rest-endpoint

1. Read `references/hooks-rest-admin.md` and `references/wordpress-security.md`.
2. Register the route on `rest_api_init` with namespace, method, callback, `permission_callback`, args, and schema where practical.
3. Validate and sanitize request data, enforce capability checks, return `WP_REST_Response` or `WP_Error`, and avoid leaking private data.
4. Add tests or smoke checks for authorized, unauthorized, invalid, and successful requests.

### create-dynamic-block

1. Read `references/blocks-gutenberg.md`; read `references/interactivity-api.md` only when frontend interactivity is needed.
2. Define block metadata in `block.json` with namespace, attributes, textdomain, assets, and render behavior.
3. Register the block server-side and keep editor assets separate from frontend assets.
4. In render callbacks, sanitize attributes and escape all output.
5. Use `@wordpress/scripts` unless the existing project already standardizes on another build tool.

### review-plugin-security

1. Read `references/wordpress-security.md` and `references/review-checklists.md`.
2. Inspect admin actions, AJAX, REST routes, shortcodes, block render callbacks, options/meta writes, SQL, filesystem operations, and external HTTP calls.
3. Prioritize findings by exploitability and user impact.
4. Recommend minimal fixes that preserve plugin behavior.

### prepare-wordpress-org-release

1. Read `references/release-wordpress-org.md`, `references/testing-and-ci.md`, and `references/source-map.md`.
2. Verify current official docs before relying on release, Plugin Check, or SVN details.
3. Check plugin headers, `readme.txt`, stable tag, changelog, license compatibility, assets, built files, and excluded development files.
4. Run Plugin Check and available test/build scripts; report unresolved warnings clearly.

### audit-plugin-performance

1. Read `references/performance-optimization.md` and the performance workflow in `references/review-checklists.md`.
2. Identify plugin type and hot paths before recommending changes.
3. Inspect hooks, assets, queries, options/autoload, transients/object cache, REST/AJAX, admin screens, blocks, cron, and external HTTP calls.
4. Separate quick wins from changes that require profiling, cache invalidation tests, or rollout monitoring.

### optimize-frontend-assets

1. Find where frontend scripts/styles are registered and enqueued.
2. Scope assets by route, shortcode, block presence, template, or feature state.
3. Preserve dependencies, versions, i18n, and security behavior.

### optimize-rest-endpoint-performance

1. Keep `permission_callback`, validation, and sanitization intact.
2. Add pagination, bounded queries, response shape limits, and safe caching only when data is public or correctly scoped.
3. Return `WP_Error` for invalid or overly expensive requests.

### optimize-dynamic-block-rendering

1. Treat block attributes as untrusted and escape output.
2. Bound render-time queries and avoid remote calls during render.
3. Add fragment caching only with a clear TTL and invalidation hooks.

### optimize-admin-screen-performance

1. Scope admin assets by screen ID.
2. Paginate tables, lazy-load expensive data, cache counts, and avoid synchronous remote calls in page render.
3. Preserve capability checks and Settings API behavior.

### optimize-database-queries

1. Bound query size and avoid N+1 patterns.
2. Use `fields => 'ids'`, `no_found_rows => true`, and cache priming where appropriate.
3. Prefer WordPress APIs; use prepared SQL and indexes when custom tables are justified.

### design-admin-settings-page

1. Read `references/design-ux-ui.md`, `references/hooks-rest-admin.md`, and `references/i18n-a11y-privacy.md`.
2. Use WordPress-native layout, clear labels/help text, Settings API save flow, capability checks, nonces, and scoped admin assets.
3. Include empty, loading, success, error, validation, RTL, text expansion, and keyboard/focus states.

### improve-plugin-dashboard-ux

1. Identify the dashboard's primary user, job, status signals, and next actions.
2. Reduce clutter, paginate heavy data, avoid global assets, and keep troubleshooting/status visible.
3. Use cards/sections only when they improve scanning and keep the screen native to wp-admin.

### design-frontend-output

1. Respect the active theme by inheriting typography, colors, and spacing where practical.
2. Use semantic HTML, scoped wrapper classes, escaped output, accessible controls, responsive CSS, and RTL-friendly logical properties.
3. Avoid global resets, hardcoded fonts, and large frontend bundles unless explicitly justified.

### design-gutenberg-block-ui

1. Use the canvas for primary content, toolbar for important contextual actions, and InspectorControls for advanced settings.
2. Prefer `@wordpress/components`, i18n-ready labels, placeholders for setup, and stable selected/unselected states.
3. Keep frontend output close to editor preview without adding unnecessary editor or frontend weight.

### audit-plugin-ui-ux

1. Read `references/design-ux-ui.md` and the design workflow in `references/review-checklists.md`.
2. Inspect admin screens, block UI, frontend output, CSS, forms, notices, and dynamic states.
3. Report UX blockers, accessibility blockers, security/performance intersections, and manual visual review needs.

### create-onboarding-flow

1. Keep setup steps short, optional where appropriate, and reversible.
2. Provide progress, back/skip/finish behavior, accessible headings, clear microcopy, and safe defaults.
3. Do not use dark patterns or hide consequences.

### improve-empty-loading-error-states

1. Define what the user sees before data exists, while work is in progress, after success, after failure, and at edge cases.
2. Preserve user input on errors and announce important async updates where appropriate.
3. Keep messages actionable, translatable, and safe.

### audit-plugin-compatibility

1. Read `references/integrations-compatibility.md` and the compatibility workflow in `references/review-checklists.md`.
2. Identify required vs optional integrations and inspect detection, adapters, fallbacks, SEO output, cache behavior, theme CSS, builder code, and editor contexts.
3. Produce a compatibility matrix with supported, partial, experimental, planned, not supported, and unknown statuses.
4. Separate safe quick fixes from items requiring current third-party docs and manual testing.

### add-classic-editor-fallback

1. Check `use_block_editor_for_post_type()` and keep block/editor assets scoped.
2. Add metabox or shortcode fallback only when users need non-block workflows.
3. Share save/render services so block and classic flows do not diverge.
4. Preserve nonce, capability, sanitization, and escaping.

### add-seo-plugin-integration

1. Detect active SEO plugins safely and verify current official docs first.
2. Avoid duplicate meta, canonical, robots, Open Graph, Twitter, breadcrumbs, and schema output.
3. Use documented hooks/APIs where available and fallback only when no SEO plugin handles the concern.

### add-cache-plugin-compatibility

1. Separate public cacheable output from private/user-specific output.
2. Add targeted purge/invalidation hooks only for relevant content or settings changes.
3. Avoid purge-all on normal requests and document manual cache exclusions only as fallback.

### add-theme-compatibility-layer

1. Prefer semantic, theme-friendly output and scoped CSS before theme-specific hooks.
2. Detect themes safely and keep adapters optional.
3. Respect block themes, classic themes, `theme.json`, responsive layout, and RTL.

### add-page-builder-adapter

1. Load Elementor, Divi, or builder-specific code only after dependency detection.
2. Use documented hooks/APIs and avoid builder internals.
3. Provide shortcode/block fallback and keep builder assets scoped.

### create-compatibility-matrix

1. List integrations, status, detection, docs, what works, risks, known issues, and manual tests.
2. Mark lightly tested or version-sensitive work as experimental.
3. Use unknown instead of pretending support exists.

### troubleshoot-plugin-conflict

1. Reproduce with the smallest plugin/theme/cache/editor combination possible.
2. Identify whether the conflict is security, performance, design, SEO, cache, theme, builder, or editor-context related.
3. Fix with feature detection, scoped assets, public hooks, graceful fallback, or documentation rather than global disabling.

## When Unsure

- Check `references/source-map.md`.
- Verify the current official WordPress, Block Editor, WP-CLI, Plugin Check, npm, Composer, or PHPUnit documentation before giving version-sensitive advice.
- Do not invent APIs, flags, hooks, metadata fields, or release rules. If uncertain, say what needs verification and use the safest documented alternative.
